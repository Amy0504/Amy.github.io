## Academic Writing

- Here is the [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SocratesAcademy/craft/blob/main/The-Craft-of-Writing.ipynb?flush_cache=true) and [Slides](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/SocratesAcademy/craft/blob/main/The-Craft-of-Writing.ipynb#/). 
- I find the Essay Writing Guide written by Jordan B Peterson is very useful. I convert it into slides and add some annotations. [The Power of Writing: Ten Steps of Essay Writing](https://computational-communication.com/workshop/notebook/Essay%20Writing%20Guide.slides.html#/). 

- Yet my favorite book is Friedrich Adler's **The Courage to be Disliked**
